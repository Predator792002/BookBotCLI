# BookBot 📘

**BookBot** is a simple Python CLI tool that analyzes a text-based book and provides a report of:

- Total word count
- Frequency of each alphabetic character (case-insensitive)
- A sorted character frequency chart

---

## 🔧 How It Works

This script reads a `.txt` book file, processes its content, and prints a report showing:
- How many words the book contains
- How often each character (a–z) appears, sorted by frequency (most to least)

---

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

```bash
python3 main.py <path_to_book>
